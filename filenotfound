3 . Write a Java program to create a method that reads a file and throws an exception if the 
file is not found. 
 
import java.io.File; 
import java.io.FileNotFoundException; 
import java.util.Scanner; 
 
public class FileReaderExample { 
 
     Main method where the program execution starts 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        try { 
             Attempt to read the file using the readFile method 
            readFile(example.txt); 
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) { 
             Handle the exception if the file is not found 
            System.out.println(e.getMessage()); 
        } 
    } 
 
     Method to read a file, throws FileNotFoundException if the file is not found 
    public static void readFile(String fileName) throws FileNotFoundException { 
        File file = new File(fileName);  Create a File object with the specified file name 
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(file);  Create a Scanner object to read the file 
 
         Read and print the content of the file line by line 
        while (scanner.hasNextLine()) { 
            System.out.println(scanner.nextLine()); 
        } 
 
        scanner.close();  Close the scanner to free resources 
    } 
}
